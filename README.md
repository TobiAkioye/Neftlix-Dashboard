# Neftlix-Dashboard

## Introduction

I created my own quick dashboard using Excel. It had graphs on a random individuals in their various region, martial status, income . This helped me analyze how users are affect to puchase a bike.


Goal: Show how users's purchase rate is affect based on different factors


Question:  How is the purchase rate currently ?

## Process

The original data was cleaned and manipulated in Microsoft Excel, then I used Excel also to create an interactive dashboard.


### Microsoft Excel
I used Microsoft Excel to clean and generate my data. I have the following columns (which are typical for bike users an non users data):

### User's Data
Marital Status	,Gender	,Income,	Children, Education,	Occupation,	Home Owner,	Cars,	Commute Distance,	Region,	Age,	Age Bracket,	Purchased Bike



I added a column "Age Bracket" to make it easier to clasify and represent the data. 

### Pivot table
I created a pivot table tha helped in creating the dashboard

### Excel Dashboard
Next I created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to show student performance. I included the following metrics:

I kept the dashboard simple and concise. I wanted the focus to be student performance over the semester. How are they doing in their tests, quizzes, and assignments? Are they improving over time? On average how are they doing? 


At the top is the title along with student information like: name, grade, and class. Useful when creating multiple dashboards for different students. Next, are the top metrics to know like the final grade and average scores. Then there are three charts for student performance in tests, quizzes, and assignments. Along with a breakdown of the type of assignments throughout the semester. At the bottom is the table of records. Essentially the raw data for the families/tutors to look at. While this isn't common or the purpose of a dashboard, people like having the ability to look at each record. 

## Insights
1. The Data shows that middle age individuals that live 1 mile away from work are the top buyers of the bike so more energy must be 
put into advertise into that age gap.

2. High School Student that live 5 mile and above are also high rate buyers of bike
3. High income earner tend to purchase more bike too
